# Temperature Analysis using Simulated Data

This C++ program provides a simulated scenario for fetching daily temperature data and determining the best time to bathe based on the highest temperature of the day.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your machine (like g++, clang++, or MSVC).

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd <repository-name>
```

## Usage

Compile the program with your C++ compiler. For example, if you are using g++, you can compile the program like this:

```bash
g++ -o temperature_analysis temperature_analysis.cpp
```

Run the compiled program:

```bash
./temperature_analysis
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to view the simulated temperature data analysis.
